A student-tutor matching Android App for the local tutoring club I founded in my city. 

## Motive
The club had an overflow of students and a limited space to hold sessions, so this app was used to manage personnel efficiently by scheduling consistent students to tutor sessions.

## Features
- Allows a maximum of two students to each tutor
- Allows students to create accounts and sign up for each week's session
- Admin account to create matches and view student/tutor availabilities

Written in Java & Kotlin
